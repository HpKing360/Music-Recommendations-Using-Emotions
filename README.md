# Title
"Music Recommendation Using Facial Emotions," leverages advanced AI technology to
provide a personalized music experience by recommending playlists that align with the user's detected
facial emotions. The application begins at the home page, which features a "Let's Start" button. Upon
clicking, users are presented with two options: they can either upload an image from their device or
use their webcam to capture a real-time photo. The application employs the DeepFace library to
analyze the uploaded or captured image, accurately detecting the user's emotions such as happiness,
sadness, anger, surprise, and more. Once the emotion is detected, the system offers immediate voice
feedback and a Swal alert message to inform the user of the identified emotion. Following this, the
user is redirected to a personalized playlist page, where music recommendations are curated to match
their emotional state. This page offers flexibility by allowing users to choose between video and audio
formats for their playlists. Additionally, the platform supports multiple languages, including English,
Tamil, Hindi, and Kannada, enabling a broader user base to enjoy the service in their preferred
language.

# Getting Started with Create React 
App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
